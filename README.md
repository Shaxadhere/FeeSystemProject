# FeeSystemProject
Student Fees Management System tracks all the details of a student from the day one to the end of his course which can be useful for all reporting purpose, tracking enrolment, status and all these will be available for future references too. We are developing an Android App using which every aspect related to fees can be involved. Through this, parents need not approach college every time for fees. They can get entire information like pending fees, paid fees, due date etc., just on single click on their mobile. Also easy for the college to maintain all these aspects just by updating the database. This App is entirely GUI based i.e., user-friendly since the users also include the parents it is easy to understand and operate. It also includes the attendance of the student apart from the fees details.
